create a barebones simple vs code config locally that changes the theme colors to a warm pink and purple sunset

# sample output

Perfect! I've created a VS Code configuration with a beautiful warm pink and purple sunset theme. Here's what I've set up:
Color Palette Used:
Deep Purple Backgrounds: #1F1420, #2D1B2D, #3D2B3D
Warm Pink Accents: #FF6B9D (primary), #FF8BB3 (hover), #FFB3D9 (lighter)
Soft Purple: #DDA0DD, #8B6B8B
Light Text: #F8E8F8
Features:
Editor: Dark purple background with warm pink cursor and selection highlights
Sidebar & Panels: Coordinated dark purple backgrounds with pink accents
Syntax Highlighting: Custom token colors that complement the sunset theme
UI Elements: Buttons, tabs, scrollbars, and inputs all styled to match
Terminal: Matching background and foreground colors
The configuration is saved in .vscode/settings.json and will automatically apply when you open this workspace in VS Code. The theme creates a cozy, warm atmosphere with the sunset-inspired pink and purple color scheme you requested.
